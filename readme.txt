Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements were:
A database with at least two tables, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords
A screen for logging into the app
Note that the screen for logging into the app should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.
A screen with a grid that displays all items in the inventory
A mechanism by which the user can add and remove items from the inventory
A mechanism by which the user can increase or decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory
A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to zero

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I only needed five screens. Keeping the inventory editor screen away from the main inventory screen ensured there were no accidental changes.
the button for editing the screen was in an easy to press location while using the phone one handed.
A login screen,
Inventory display grid,
Inventory editor,
and registration screen were necessary.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I was able to gain all the requirements and follow them like instructions. 
I was also able to see potential faults for the future and address those as well before any development was done on them.
Finding potential with current requirements was also nice. It's not enough to find just issues, it's better to find unseen strengths too.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Testing is one of the most crucial parts of development. Testing should start as early as possible with as many scenarios as possible.
Sometimes, when testing an app, handing it to someone else with a goal is a great way to get data on user navigation potential and feel.
If the app sucks and it's been production for a long time, there will be a lot of wasted money and time. Testing irons these issues out early.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Learning about how Android Studio works was something new to me. 
Learning about how dependencies work was important to getting the project to work.
Planning started with requirements and then building more based off of that.
Following requirments like instructions and building the project worked well from there.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Adding borders, adding a database, adding database modification capability through the app was nice.
I only wish I had more time to work on the project since I had family emergencies to attend to back to back.
